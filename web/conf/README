This directory contains configuration fragments for running Keystone
Resolver under various web servers.  In particular:

apache1.3 -- configuration-file segments for the 1.3.x series of the
	Apache web server with mod_perl 1.x.  Each file in this
	directory is named after the host where is is used.  Pick
	whichever is closest to what you need and tweak it as needed.

apache2.0 -- configuration-file segments for the 2.0.x series of
	Apache with mod_perl 2.x.  The provided files are tweaked
	versions of what various customers are using, but WE DO NOT
	USE THEM OURSELVES so they're provided "as is" for guidance
	only.

Maybe IIS fragments and similar to follow one day.

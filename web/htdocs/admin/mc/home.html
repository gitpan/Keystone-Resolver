  <h2>A brief guide to the resolver objects</h2>
  <p>
   <b>Genres</b>
   are the kinds of things that you might find a reference for in
   a resource discovery service such as an abstracts-and-indexing service
   or a metasearch site.  The most common and complex case is journal
   articles, but books are also important.  The complete list (from the
   widely-implemented v0.1 of the OpenURL standard) is:
   <blockquote>
	journal, book, conference, article, preprint, proceeding,
	bookitem
   </blockquote>
   And the list in v1.0 (Part 2, page 39) is:
   <blockquote>
	journal, issue, article, conference, proceeding, preprint,
	unknown
   </blockquote>
   It may appear that v1.0 of the standard has dropped support for
   representing books, but this is not so: in OpenURL 1.0, books are
   represented by a completely different metadata format (refered to here
   as an mformat).  The standard's specification of the San Antonio
   Profile (Part 2, page 77) lists five KEV metadata formats:
   <blockquote>
	book, dissertation, journal, patent, sch_svc
   </blockquote>
   of which only journal is described in the standard (Part 2, page 35).
   Each mformat has a default genre, which is assumed for entities that
   do not explicitly specify one; multiple mformats may share the same
   default genre.
  </p>
  <p>
   (The only use of the mformat table is to map a metadata-format URI onto a
   default genre in the case of v1.0 OpenURLs that specify the former but
   not the latter.)
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Service types</b>
   are the kinds of things that an OpenURL might resolve
   to.  The most common and important case is the full text of the
   article (typically but not always as a PDF), as provided by a content
   aggregator.  Other important cases include abstracts, web-searches,
   on-line book-stores, local library catalogue's holdings, ILL requests
   and citations in some specific format.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is a complex many-to-many relationship between genres and
   service types.  For example, the genre ``book'' can be resolved by an
   online-bookstore or web-search service, but not by content aggregators
   as they deal in serials.  Conversely, the genre ``article'' can be
   resolved by an aggregator or a web-search service, but not by an
   online book-store.
  </p>
  <p>
   Service Providers, or just
   <b>Providers</b>
   for short, are organisations that
   provide services that a link might resolve to.  For example, Elsevier
   and Gale are both providers.  Each provider provides one or more
   services.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Services</b>
   are specific implementations of a given service type, and
   each is provided by a particular provider.  For example, Elsevier
   provides a service of type ``aggregator'', and Google and Alltheweb are
   both services of type ``web search''.  Each service has exactly one
   service type and one provider; but there may be any number of services
   of each type, and any number of services may be provided by a single
   provider.  Services may be disabled.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Serials</b>
   (including journals, proceedings, etc.) are places where
   individual articles, papers, etc. are published.  A service may
   provide access to many serials, and many services may provide access
   to a serial, so this is a many-to-many relationship.
  </p>
  <p>
   An
   <b>identity</b>
   is anyone or anything that might be trying to resolve an
   OpenURL: an individual, a group, a department, an organisation, a
   consortium or anything in between.  In all cases, the identity
   consists of a name, a level (person, group, etc.) and a parent pointer
   indicating the containing identity if any: for example, Index Data is
   the parent of Mike Taylor, and ILCSO is the parent of Champaign
   Library; but ILCSO itself has no parent.
  </p>
  <p>
   <b>Credentials</b>
   are sets of context=value pairs, such as the set
   user=mike, password=fruit.  Each such credential set is associated
   with a particular identity and particular service (typically but not
   necessarily an aggregator service).  A given set of credentials is
   what a particular identity needs to use in order to access a
   particular service.  For example, Index Data might need to use
   user=index pass=apple to access Elsevier, but user=id pass=pear to
   access Science Direct.
  </p>
  <p>
   Some OpenURLs contain non-standard opaque identifiers such as local
   catalogue numbers.  According to the standard, OpenURLs that do this
   must also include an indication of the vocabulary from which the
   identifier is drawn, e.g ``this is a Library of Croyden call number''.
   Such an identifier is called a
   <b>SID</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
   A
   <b>Source</b>
   is a site that can generate OpenURLs.  Several sites may use
   the same non-standard identifier, so there is a one-to-many
   relationship between SIDs and sources.
  </p>
  <p>
   Configuration information is held as a set of name=value pairs called
   <b>Config</b>
   objects, which can be thought of as broadly analogous to
   environment variables.
  </p>
  <p>
   And, finally,
   <b>Domains</b>
   associate specific Internet domains with a
   status drawn from a small set of allowable values, indicating what
   approach we should take to fetching ContextObjects, Descriptors and
   Identifier results from them.  The C<status> field may contains the
   values:
   <ul>
    <li>
	0 (always) -- fetch data from this domain when an OpenURL says
		to do so, and treat failure as fatal.
    </li>
    <li>
	1 (never) -- never try to fetch data from this domain, but
		continue with the resolution process.
    </li>
    <li>
	2 (ignore) -- try to fetch data from this domain when
		requested, but ignore failure and continue resolving.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  </p>

This directory contains resource database material, including schemas,
sample data and database-creation utilities.  Ultimately, Keystone
Resolver will run against any standard relational database, but for
now we are only going to think about MySQL for simplicity's sake.

The declarations in this directory constitute an implementation of the
data model described in "../doc/data-model".  If you change anything
here, please make sure you also update the corresponding description
in that file.

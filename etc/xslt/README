This directory contains XSLT templates used by the Keystone Resolver
to generate HTML output from the standard XML form.  The resolver's
"xsltdir" option (i.e. the "opt_xsltdir" OpenURL parameter) must be
set to point to this directory.

In normal use, the stylesheet called "default" (that is, the file
called "default.xsl" in the nominated directory) is used; but this can
be overridden by specifying the resolver's "xslt" option (i.e. the
"opt_xslt" OpenURL parameter).

The default.xsl in CVS and in the distribution is a copy of
"designed.xsl", but it's only this way due to limitations in both CVS
and the Perl packaging system.  It's useful to remove default.xsl and
remake it as a symbolic link -- for example:
	rm default.xsl
	ln -s designed.xsl default.xsl

There are no long-term plans to use this at DBC, but it's referenced
in a specific OpenURL that I need to use for debugging, so it's useful
to have around so that I am doing exactly the same thing as they are.

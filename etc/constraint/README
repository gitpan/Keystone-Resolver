This directory contains constraints for the XML generated by Keystone
Resolver when the "xml" option is set.  At present, the only such file
is "results-1.0.dtd", which is insultingly simple.  A more stringent
Relax-NG schema will probably follow, with subequivalant XML Schema
and DTD automatically generated from it.
